# Prototyping

## Implementation and E2E Testing

You can use [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/) as a Container Manager and environment setup.
You can use [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
You can use [rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/framework/react)

## Frontend

Create a simple project using react and typescript, no CSS need it, just simple input box and text display would be enough.
